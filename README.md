# Carthage

Carthage builds the dependencies and fetchs binary frameworks. It lets retain full control over a project structure and setup.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions from the official documentation of Carthage to install on your machine [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage).

## Build dependencies

To build the project's dependencies run the following command in the terminal where the `Cartfile` is located.

```bash
carthage update

```

You can add the option `--platform` to build only a specific platform (e.g. `iOS`).
